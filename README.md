# Data Visualization Project
This project analyses BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024 to uncover sales patterns and customer preferences that can inform both marketing and strategic decision-making. By combining exploratory data analysis with visualisation techniques, I aim to reveal insights about model performance, regional demand, and evolving trends in the automotive market.

This work is part of my data visualisation project, where I will develop prototypes, iterate on sketches, and eventually deliver an interactive visualisation dashboard.
## Data

The dataset used is BMW Sales Data (2010–2024) with 50,000 entries. It is provided in CSV format for this course. Comparable public datasets also exist (e.g., BMW Sales 2010–2024 on Kaggle
).

Key Fields

Year – Sales year (2010–2024).

Model – Specific BMW model sold.

Region – Geographic sales area (Asia, North America, etc.).

Color – Vehicle color preference.

Fuel_Type – Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, etc.

Transmission – Manual vs Automatic.

Engine_Size_L – Engine size in liters.

Mileage_KM – Mileage of the vehicle.

Price_USD – Price of the vehicle in USD.

Sales_Volume – Number of units sold.

Sales_Classification – Sales performance (High or Low).

## Data Analysis Plan

Data Cleaning – Address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Use descriptive statistics and visual summaries to explore trends.

Visualization Prototypes – Apply different techniques (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, stacked bars) to answer the research questions.

Marketing Insights Extraction – Translate findings into actionable insights for marketing and strategic positioning.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
Sales Trends Over Time – How have BMW’s sales volumes evolved between 2010 and 2024?

Model Performance – Which BMW models consistently dominate sales, and how has this changed?

Regional Differences – Which regions prefer which models, and how do fuel types or transmission choices vary geographically?

Customer Preferences – Do features like color, engine size, or price correlate with higher sales?

Strategic Insights – What lessons can BMW’s marketing team draw from these patterns?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)


## Prototypes

Planned Visualizations for BMW Data

Bar Chart – Top 10 BMW models by sales volume.

Line Chart – Sales trends over time (2010–2024).

Stacked Bar Chart – Sales volume breakdown by region.

Scatter Plot – Engine size vs. price, colored by sales classification.

Interactive Prototype (VizHub)

I also developed an interactive bar chart (using a population dataset) on VizHub to experiment with hover-tooltips and clickable bars:
👉 Interactive Bar Chart Prototype

This interaction model will later be applied to BMW sales data (e.g., hovering to see sales volumes, filtering by region or model).

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)

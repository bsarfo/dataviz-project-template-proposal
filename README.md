# Data Visualization Project
This project analyses BMW sales data from 2010 to 2024 to uncover sales patterns and customer preferences that can inform both marketing and strategic decision-making. By combining exploratory data analysis with visualisation techniques, I aim to reveal insights about model performance, regional demand, and evolving trends in the automotive market.

This work is part of my data visualisation project, where I will develop prototypes, iterate on sketches, and eventually deliver an interactive visualisation dashboard.
## Data

The dataset used is the BMW Sales Data (2010â€“2024), comprising 50,000 entries. It is provided in CSV format for this course. Comparable public datasets also exist (e.g., BMW Sales 2010â€“2024 on Kaggle
).

Key Fields

Year â€“ Sales year (2010â€“2024).

Model â€“ Specific BMW model sold.

Region â€“ Geographic sales area (Asia, North America, Africa, Europe, and Middle East).

Color â€“ Vehicle color preference.

Fuel_Type â€“ Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, etc.

Transmission â€“ Manual vs Automatic.

Engine_Size_L â€“ Engine size in liters.

Mileage_KM â€“ Mileage of the vehicle.

Price_USD â€“ Price of the vehicle in USD.

Sales_Volume â€“ Number of units sold.

Sales_Classification â€“ Sales performance (High or Low).

## Data Analysis Plan

Data Cleaning â€“ Address missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Use descriptive statistics and visual summaries to explore trends.

Visualization Prototypes â€“ Apply different techniques (bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, stacked bars) to answer the research questions.

Marketing Insights Extraction â€“ Translate findings into actionable insights for marketing and strategic positioning.

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:
Sales Trends Over Time â€“ How have BMWâ€™s sales volumes evolved between 2010 and 2024?

Model Performance â€“ Which BMW models consistently dominate sales, and how has this changed?

Regional Differences â€“ Which regions prefer which models, and how do fuel types or transmission choices vary geographically?

Customer Preferences â€“ Do features like color, engine size, or price correlate with higher sales?

Strategic Insights â€“ What lessons can BMWâ€™s marketing team draw from these patterns?

## Prototypes

Planned Visualizations for BMW Data

Bar Chart â€“ Top 10 BMW models by sales volume.

Line Chart â€“ Sales trends over time (2010â€“2024).

Stacked Bar Chart â€“ Sales volume breakdown by region.

Scatter Plot â€“ Engine size vs. price, colored by sales classification.

Interactive Prototype (VizHub)

I also developed an interactive bar chart (using a population dataset) on VizHub to experiment with hover-tooltips and clickable bars:

This interaction model will later be applied to BMW sales data (e.g., hovering to see sales volumes, filtering by region or model).


## Open Questions

I am confident about the direction of the project, but I do have a few concerns. Since the dataset is synthetic, Iâ€™m not sure how realistic some fields (like mileage or sales classification) are, which may affect the authenticity of insights. I also want to explore regional differences, but I may not have access to detailed geographic shapes or data for mapping. Finally, while Iâ€™ve sketched interactive ideas like hover-tooltips and filters, Iâ€™m uncertain about how smoothly I can implement them in D3.js. These challenges may require me to simplify some aspects, but they will also push me to learn through iteration.

## Milestones

Week 1: Define project scope, document dataset fields, and draft initial research questions. Create first static sketches (bar chart practice with population data).

Week 2: Clean and explore the BMW dataset. Generate descriptive statistics and begin simple visualizations (bar chart of top models, line chart of total sales by year).

Week 3: Develop refined sketches and prototype visualizations. Experiment with different encodings (colors, labels, highlights) and iterate on clarity.

Week 4: Introduce interactivity (hover-tooltips, sorting, filtering) using VizHub or D3.js. Connect prototypes to BMW dataset instead of practice data.

Week 5: Combine insights into a more cohesive dashboard. Add annotations and highlight key findings (e.g., top-selling models, regional differences).

Week 6: Polish visuals, finalize README writeup, and ensure interactivity works smoothly. Prepare final submission with a clear narrative linking research questions to visualizations and insights.
